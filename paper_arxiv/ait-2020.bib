abstract="This paper gives an overview of our recent work on an approach to verifying multi-agent programs. We automatically translate multi-agent systems programmed in the logic-based agent-oriented programming language AgentSpeak into either Promela or Java, and then use the associated Spin and JPF model checkers to verify the resulting systems. We also describe the simplified BDI logical language that is used to write the properties we want the systems to satisfy. The approach is illustrated by means of a simple case study.",

abstract="Collaborative robots could transform several industries, such as manufacturing and healthcare, but they present a significant challenge to verification. The complex nature of their working environment necessitates testing in realistic detail under a broad range of circumstances. We propose the use of Coverage-Driven Verification (CDV) to meet this challenge. By automating the simulation-based testing process as far as possible, CDV provides an efficient route to coverage closure. We discuss the need, practical considerations, and potential benefits of transferring this approach from microelectronic design verification to the field of human-robot interaction. We demonstrate the validity and feasibility of the proposed approach by constructing a custom CDV testbench and applying it to the verification of an object handover task.",
