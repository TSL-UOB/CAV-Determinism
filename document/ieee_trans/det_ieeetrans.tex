\begin{IEEEbiography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{../other/mugs/severin}}]{S\'everin Lemaignan}
is Associate Professor in Social Robotics and AI at the Bristol Robotics Laboratory, University of the West of England, Bristol. He obtained a joint PhD in Cognitive Robotics from the CNRS/LAAS (France) and the Technical University of Munich (Germany) in 2012. He then joined the EPFL (Switzerland) and Plymouth University (UK) as post-doc, then lecturer in Robotics until 2018, when he joined the Bristol Robotics Lab. His research interest primarily concerns the socio-cognitive aspects of human-robot interaction and he has been focusing his recent experimental work on child-robot interaction and human-in-the-loop machine learning for social robots. Pr.\ S\'everin Lemaignan has been involved in several European projects related to social and cognitive robotics (CHRIS, DREAM, L2TOR) and was  awarded in 2015 a EU H2020 Marie Sk\l{}odowska-Curie Individual Fellowship for his project on robots and theory of mind.

\begin{IEEEbiography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{../other/mugs/tony}}]{Tony Pipe} 
received his BSc (Hons.) degree in Electronic Engineering from Warwick in 1979 and, after an eight-year period in industry that included running a small company, received his PhD in Robotics from the University of the West of England (UWE) in 1997. Since 2010 he has been a Professor of Robotics and Autonomous Systems at UWE. He was a founding member of the Bristol Robotics Laboratory (BRL), and acted as one of its two Deputy Directors from its inception in 2006 until 2020. His research interests focus on safe and correct operation whilst in close-proximity to human beings. He has co-authored over 200 international refereed publications, supervised 35 PhDs, and created a BRL income of \pounds10M since 2013. 
%He has acted as BRL-UWE PI on the EPSRC grant ‘Trustworthy Robotic Assistants’, the Programme/Hub grants ‘Robotics for Nuclear Environments’ and ‘National Centre for Nuclear Robotics’, and the Centre for Doctoral Training in Robotics and Autonomous Systems. 
Prof.\ Pipe has been involved with Connected Autonomous Vehicle research and development since 2015 via the Innovate UK/CCAV funded projects VENTURER, FLOURISH, MultiCAV, CAPRI, ROBOPILOT and CAV-Forth.

is Professor of Computer Science and heads the Trustworthy Systems Laboratory at the University of Bristol, UK. She also leads the Verification and Validation for Safety in Robots research theme at the  Bristol Robotics Laboratory. 
%She has gained extensive experience of verifying complex microelectronic designs while working with leading semiconductor design and Electronic Design Automation companies worldwide. Her research is focused on specification, verification and analysis techniques to verify or explore a system's behaviour in terms of functional correctness, safety, security, performance and energy efficiency. 
Prof.\ Eder's most recent contributions include agent-based testing, how to use assertions and theorem proving to verify control system designs as well as novel energy modeling and static resource analysis techniques to predict energy consumption of software. She holds a PhD in Computational Logic and an MSc in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Bristol, UK, in addition to an MEng in Informatics (Dipl.\,Inf.) from the Technical University Dresden, Germany. In 2007 she was awarded an ``Excellence in Engineering'' prize from the Royal Academy of Engineering, UK.
